# Task Context: CFF-007 - Git Initialization

**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Associated Task ID:** CFF-007
**Overall Project:** ChromeFormFiller MVP

## 1. Objective
Initialize a Git repository in the project's root directory (`/home/jack-friendly/personal-repos/chrome-form-filler`) and create an appropriate `.gitignore` file for a Chrome extension project using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and potentially Supabase-related local development files.

## 2. Key Requirements & Scope
*   **Git Initialization:**
    *   Execute `git init` in the workspace root directory.
*   **`.gitignore` File Creation:**
    *   Create a `.gitignore` file in the workspace root.
    *   The `.gitignore` file should include common patterns for:
        *   Node.js projects (e.g., `node_modules/`, `package-lock.json` if `package.json` is present - though not explicitly created yet, good to have).
        *   Operating System specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`).
        *   IDE and editor specific files (e.g., `.vscode/`, `.idea/`).
        *   Build artifacts or packaged extension files (e.g., `dist/`, `*.zip`, `*.crx`).
        *   Local environment files (e.g., `.env`).
        *   Supabase local development files if any common ones exist (e.g., `supabase/temp/`, `*.log` within `supabase/` if applicable - Researcher might provide more specific patterns if needed, but general log/temp patterns are a good start).

## 3. Deliverables
*   A Git repository initialized in the project root.
*   A `.gitignore` file created in the project root with appropriate ignore patterns.
*   Confirmation of task completion.

## 4. Dependencies
*   CFF-006: Project Structure Setup (Completed) - The basic file structure is now in place.

This context file is for GitMaster to initialize the repository.
