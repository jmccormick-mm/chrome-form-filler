# Task Context: CFF-012 - Initial Commit

**Overall Task:** ChromeFormFiller MVP Development - Initial Git Commit

**Objective:**
Create an initial Git commit that includes all the work done for the MVP features up to and including Task CFF-011. This encompasses the project setup, context menu, Supabase Edge Function for LLM proxy, background script updates, and content script updates for response handling.

**Key Instructions & Scope:**
*   **Files to Commit:** All new and modified files within the project directory that are part of the MVP implementation. This includes:
    *   `manifest.json`
    *   `src/background/background.js`
    *   `src/content/content_script.js`
    *   `src/core/supabaseClient.js`
    *   `supabase/functions/llm-proxy/index.ts`
    *   All relevant documentation files in `docs/` (architecture, design, project management, research, reflections).
    *   `.gitignore`
*   **Commit Message:** Use a clear and descriptive commit message, such as "feat: Implement initial MVP for ChromeFormFiller".
    *   The message should summarize the core functionality implemented (context menu, LLM proxy via Supabase, form field filling).
*   **Branch:** Ensure the commit is made on the main/master branch (or the primary development branch if one was specified, though none has been for this MVP).

**Deliverables:**
1.  Confirmation that the initial commit has been successfully made.
2.  The commit hash (optional, but good for reference).

**Dependencies:**
*   CFF-011: Core Feature: Prompt & Response Handling (Completed)
*   All preceding tasks (CFF-001 to CFF-010)

**Interaction Mode:**
YOLO MVP (as per [`docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`](docs/project-management/workflow-state.md:7)).

**Next Steps upon Completion:**
Inform Maestro that the initial commit has been made. The next task will be CFF-013 (MVP Review).
