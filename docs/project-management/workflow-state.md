# Workflow State: Chrome Form Filler Extension

## Project Name:
ChromeFormFiller

## Selected Interaction Mode:
YOLO MVP: Modes will make autonomous decisions to deliver a Minimum Viable Product as quickly as possible, with minimal questions.

## Overall Task:
Design and implement a simple Chrome extension that allows users to right-click on an input/textarea field, use an LLM API to determine the intended question/prompt, formulate a response, and either auto-fill or provide a copy button. Initially, choose the easiest LLM provider for setup.

## Current Status:
Task CFF-011 (Prompt & Response Handling in Content Script) completed. Next: Task CFF-012 (Initial Commit) is In Progress.
