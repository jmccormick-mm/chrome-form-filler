# ApiArchitect Reflection Log

## Task ID: CFF-010.A - Create Supabase Edge Function: `llm-proxy`
**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Interaction Mode:** YOLO MVP

**Key Decisions & Assumptions:**

1.  **API Key Storage & Retrieval:**
    *   Assumed `api_key_encrypted` column in `user_llm_api_keys` table stores the *directly usable* OpenAI API key for MVP. Decryption logic (e.g., with `pgsodium`) was noted as a future hardening step in the context docs, and for MVP, direct use with RLS as the primary guard is acceptable.
    *   The function uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to bypass RLS for retrieving the key, which is standard practice for this type of backend operation.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implemented specific error responses for common scenarios: missing/invalid JWT (401), missing `fieldContext` (400), API key not found (403), server configuration errors (500), OpenAI API errors (502).
    *   A generic "Internal server error" (500) is used for other unexpected errors.
    *   Checked for `PGRST116` error code from Supabase when a key is not found for a user, providing a specific 403 error.

3.  **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   A basic prompt is constructed using available `fieldContext` properties (`labelText`, `placeholder`, `currentValue`).
    *   The prompt is designed to be concise and requests a completion or appropriate value, with a fallback for insufficient context. This is a starting point for MVP and can be refined.

4.  **OpenAI Model:**
    *   Used `gpt-4o-mini` as specified as recommended in the research findings and task context for a balance of capability and cost.
    *   Set `max_tokens` to 150 and `temperature` to 0.7 as reasonable defaults for MVP. These can be made configurable later if needed.

5.  **CORS Handling:**
    *   Included standard CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, etc.) and an OPTIONS preflight request handler. For production, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` should be restricted to the Chrome extension's origin.

6.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   The function relies on `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (implicitly available in Supabase Edge Functions), and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (must be explicitly set in function settings). These are standard for Supabase.

7.  **Deno/TypeScript Imports:**
    *   Used `https://deno.land/std@0.203.0/http/server.ts` for the HTTP server and `https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2` for the Supabase client library, which are common for Deno projects. Versioning is explicit.
    *   The linter errors regarding Deno types and remote modules are acknowledged as likely local VS Code configuration issues not affecting Deno runtime.

8.  **Security:**
    *   JWT is verified before any action.
    *   User's OpenAI API key is fetched server-side and never exposed to the client.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   None during the code generation phase beyond the anticipated linter/type-checking messages for Deno in a standard TS environment.

**Learnings/Confirmations:**
*   The overall flow aligns well with Supabase Edge Function capabilities for creating a secure proxy.
*   Environment variable management is crucial for secure keys (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).

**Notes for Maestro/Next Steps:**
*   The `llm-proxy` function code is complete at [`supabase/functions/llm-proxy/index.ts`](supabase/functions/llm-proxy/index.ts:1).
*   **Required Environment Variables for Supabase Edge Function `llm-proxy` settings:**
    *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: The service role key for your Supabase project.
    *   (Implicitly used by Supabase runtime: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
*   The function assumes the `user_llm_api_keys` table exists with the schema defined in [`docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md`](docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md:65).
*   For MVP, API key decryption is out of scope as per context, relying on RLS and secure backend handling. This should be logged as technical debt for future enhancement.
