- **[2025-05-26 08:10 AM] Task CFF-007: Git Initialization**
    - Successfully initialized Git repository in the project root (`/home/jack-friendly/personal-repos/chrome-form-filler`) using `git init`.
    - Created a [`.gitignore`](.gitignore:1) file in the project root.
    - The [`.gitignore`](.gitignore:1) content was based on specifications in [`docs/project-management/task-context-CFF-007.md`](docs/project-management/task-context-CFF-007.md:1) and [`docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md`](docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md:1), covering:
        - Node.js (including `package-lock.json` proactively, as `package.json` was recently added)
        - OS-specific files
        - IDE and editor files
        - Build artifacts/packaged extension files
        - Local environment files (e.g., `.env`)
        - Common Supabase local development temporary/log files (e.g., `supabase/temp/`, `supabase/.branches/`, `supabase/**/*.log`).
    - Assumption: The provided Supabase ignore patterns are sufficient for MVP. If more specific patterns are identified, the [`.gitignore`](.gitignore:1) can be updated.
    - Note: The `git init` command output a hint regarding the default branch name `master`. For future tasks, consider renaming the default branch to `main` as per modern best practices. This can be done with `git branch -m main`.
