## Task CFF-004: Technology Research for Chrome Form Filler Extension

**Date:** 2025-05-26

**Summary of Actions:**
Researched best practices for Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) development, including manifest configuration, context menu creation, DOM interaction for context gathering, API key storage, and OpenAI API integration. Compiled findings into `docs/research/research-findings.md`.

**Key Decisions/Assumptions Made:**
*   Prioritized official documentation and current best practices for Manifest V3.
*   Focused on simplicity and MVP requirements, e.g., using `chrome.storage.local` for API key storage as specified in project documents, despite security warnings from official Chrome documentation. This was noted in the research findings.
*   Recommended `gpt-4o-mini` as the primary model for OpenAI API calls due to its balance of cost, speed, and capability, with `gpt-3.5-turbo` as a fallback.
*   Assumed direct API calls from the background script to OpenAI are acceptable for the MVP, as outlined in the architectural vision.

**Issues Encountered/Challenges:**
*   The primary challenge was reconciling the MVP requirement of using `chrome.storage.local` for API key storage with the official Chrome documentation's warning against this practice due to lack of encryption. The decision was made to proceed as per MVP requirements but to clearly document the security implications.

**Learnings:**
*   The `editable` context for `chrome.contextMenus` is a convenient way to target form input fields.
*   `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is the modern and preferred method for clipboard operations in content scripts.
*   OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` appears to be a strong candidate for MVP projects requiring a balance of performance and cost.

**Suggestions for Future Tasks:**
*   For a post-MVP version, investigate more secure methods for API key storage and management if the extension handles sensitive user data or API keys with broader permissions.
*   Consider implementing more sophisticated context-gathering techniques beyond basic DOM properties if the initial heuristic proves insufficient.
