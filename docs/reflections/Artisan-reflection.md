## Task CFF-005: UI/UX Design (MVP) for Chrome Form Filler Extension
**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Interaction Mode:** YOLO MVP

*   **Decision:** Proceeded autonomously to define a minimal UI/UX based on the provided context documents ([`docs/project-management/task-context-new-project-ChromeFormFiller.md`](docs/project-management/task-context-new-project-ChromeFormFiller.md), [`docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md`](docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md), [`docs/research/research-findings.md`](docs/research/research-findings.md), [`docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`](docs/project-management/workflow-state.md)).
*   **Key Assumption (API Key Input):** Leveraged a standard Chrome extension options page (`options.html`) for API key input, as this is a common and straightforward pattern for users and developers, aligning with MVP simplicity.
*   **Key Assumption (Response Display):** Opted for a dual approach for response presentation: auto-fill attempt combined with a temporary notification that includes a "Copy" button. This provides immediate utility and a reliable fallback, fitting MVP requirements.
*   **Key Assumption (Error Handling):** Designed simple, clear notifications for common error states (API key missing, API call failure) to guide the user without overwhelming them.
*   **UI Minimization:** Focused on using native browser/extension UI elements (context menu, basic HTML controls for options page, simple notification popups) to keep the design lightweight and easy to implement for an MVP. ASCII mockups were used to convey the simple layouts.
*   **User Flow Definition:** Mapped out the primary user flows including happy path, API key setup, and basic error scenarios to ensure the core interactions are covered.
*   **Deliverable:** Created [`docs/design/design-system-CFF-MVP.md`](docs/design/design-system-CFF-MVP.md) to document these decisions, user flows, and minimal UI element descriptions.
*   **Learning:** The "YOLO MVP" mode encourages rapid decision-making based on available information, which is efficient for getting a baseline design established quickly. The provided context documents were crucial for making informed assumptions.
