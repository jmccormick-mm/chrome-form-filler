# Maestro Reflection Log

- [2025-05-26 06:21 AM] Task CFF-003: Incorrectly instructed Visionary to obtain user approval for tech stack despite 'YOLO MVP' mode selected. Visionary correctly made an autonomous decision and logged the conflict. Corrective Action: Will strictly adhere to Interaction Mode rules in future delegations, ensuring that modes requiring user interaction are only instructed to do so when the Interaction Mode is 'Follow MVP' or 'Follow Production'. For 'YOLO' modes, instructions for user consultation on decisions that should be autonomous will be avoided.
