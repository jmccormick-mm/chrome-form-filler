- [2025-05-26 06:19 AM] Task CFF-003: Refused Maestro instruction to 'Discuss high-level architecture and technology stack options directly with the user and obtain their approval' as it violates the selected 'YOLO MVP' Interaction Mode (Rules #7, #8, #9). Proceeding autonomously to define architecture and tech stack.
- [2025-05-26 08:03 AM] Task CFF-003.A: Revised architectural vision to incorporate Supabase for backend (Auth, DB with RLS for API keys, Edge Functions as LLM proxy). Incorporated user-provided Supabase project details and preferences (Google OAuth, service key handling). Documented changes in `docs/architecture/architectural-vision-CFF-MVP.md`. Updated `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md`. The revised architecture significantly enhances security by moving API key storage and LLM calls to a backend, addressing a key limitation of the original MVP design. The "YOLO MVP" interaction mode was followed, but specific user inputs for Supabase were integrated as per task requirements. The revised document is now pending user approval as specified in the task, which is a slight deviation from pure YOLO but necessary for this specific integration.
