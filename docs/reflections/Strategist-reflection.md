-   **[5/26/2025, 6:18:11 AM] Task CFF-002: Detailed Requirements Gathering for ChromeFormFiller (YOLO MVP)**
    *   **Decision - LLM Provider for MVP:** Selected OpenAI.
        *   **Reasoning:** Aligns with the user's request for "easiest to setup and get running" for an MVP due to its comprehensive documentation, widely available SDKs/libraries, and general ease of API integration.
    *   **Assumption - API Key Management:** Assumed `chrome.storage.local` is sufficient and appropriate for MVP-level API key storage, prioritizing simplicity.
    *   **Assumption - Input Context Identification:** Assumed a basic heuristic (combining text from `id`, `name`, `placeholder`, `aria-label` attributes, and associated `<label>` elements) is adequate for MVP context identification. Advanced DOM parsing or NLP techniques were deemed out of scope for MVP.
    *   **Assumption - Response Presentation:** Based on user input, assumed direct auto-fill into the input field is preferred, with a copy button as a necessary fallback for MVP.
    *   **Process - Interaction Mode Adherence:** Successfully operated under "YOLO MVP" mode. All requirements were inferred based on the initial prompt and MVP best practices without resorting to `ask_followup_question`.
    *   **Learning:** The "YOLO MVP" mode requires careful interpretation of the initial request to define a minimal yet functional scope. Balancing "minimum" with "viable" is key.
